# About

This website is intended to help current (and future students)
of BCIT's COMP 3725 Intro To Data Communications for CST course.
This is where I will be compiling my notes every week.
There will be parallels with the lectures (duh), 
but it's not a one-to-one copy and should not be considered as a replacement/alternative to other course, more like a supplement.

## To future students and other sets

Since this is just a single summer session, course material may change, and I don't think I will be able to change it myself, so feel free to fork it or ask to be a contributor! You can contact me via GitHub or LinkedIn.

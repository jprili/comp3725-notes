# Introduction

## Data Communications

Communication is essentially the movement of information,
where it can be local (within a system) or remote (between systems).

In extension, data communications is defined as: 

> ... the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission media.

So, in a communicating system, there must be at least two devices,
and a (physical) way to transport information between the devices.

### Components

Two devices and a medium is an informal way to describe
the components of a data communications system.
Formally, there are five components in a data communications system.

1. Sender (TX)
2. Receiver (RX)
3. Medium
4. Message
5. Protocol
